# Codec Algorithms
:::{note}
This codec is **<u>not</u>** an encryption algorithm, since it is openly published here.
Therefore, this codec is perfectly legal for use under amateur radio regulations.
:::


## Python3 Implementation
:::{important}
This is the **reference implementation.**
Other implementations should yield identical results as the test examples contained in the Python3 implementation.
:::
- [Python3](https://github.com/aprs438/aprs438.protocol/blob/main/codec.py) codec algorithms and tests


## C Implementations
- [C for PC](https://github.com/aprs434/aprs434.github.io/blob/main/code/codec.cpp) codec algorithms and tests
- Arduino C for ESP32 codec algorithms (under development)
