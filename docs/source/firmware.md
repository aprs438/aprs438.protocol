## Tracker Firmware
Currently, we are offering {download}`tracker firmware v.0.4.0 <https://github.com/aprs434/lora.tracker>`
that is still compatible with the iâ€‘gate developed by Peter Buchegger, OE5BPA.

This tracker **only sends 30 bytes of payload data,** instead of the usual 113 bytes.

See [Road Map](#road-map) for further developments.


## Terminal Firmware
Currently under development; see [Road Map](#road-map).


## I-Gate Firmware
Currently under development; see [Road Map](#road-map).
