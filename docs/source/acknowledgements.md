# Acknowledgements

- Ricardo Guzman Christie, CD2RXU, for developing client and i‑gate firmware employing the compression algorithms presented in this white paper.
- Folkert Tijdens, PA0FOT, for contributing [`compression.cpp`](code/codec.cpp) and asking the right questions, rendering this document more scholarly
- Matthias Brändli, HB9EGM, for contributing the Arduino C implementation of the `tttt` codec algorithm.

- Bernd Gasser, OE1ACM, for the earliest LoRa APRS experiments and code
- Christian Johann Bauer, OE3CJB, for the Base91 geolocation compression algorithm
- Peter Buchegger, OE5BPA, for providing a tracker and i‑gate firmware as open source code, in a handy [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) environment, with [over-the-air (OTA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_programming) i‑gate updates. This was the ideal starting point for running LoRa frame compression experiments.

- Greg Stroobandt, ON3GR, for cycling around the city with a privacy invading tracker
- Erwin Fiten, ON8AR, for testing firmware and reporting on long distance car approaches to the LoRa i‑gate
- Pascal Schiks, PA3FKM, for providing insights about microcontroller stacks
- Jan Engelen, DL6ZG, for testing firmware and providing feedback
